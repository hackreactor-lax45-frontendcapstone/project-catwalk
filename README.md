# 1.0 Description

The Project-Catwalk site was built with a React 16.0 front end and uses Redux for state management. A node express server serves up the site on an AWS instance, which was utilized at the time of development. (Note instance has been deactivated to save on hosting costs for this project). The express server utilizes custom routing and controller to allow the front end components to independently and asynchronously updated as necessary, which minimizes the amount of data transmitted during live site deployment to only that data which needs to be updated based on the action initiated.

Styling was completed using vanilla CSS and flexbox for educational pursposes, though the team did briefly explore Boostrap-React and SASS libraries to understand their offerings.

All components are built to follow strong 'separation of concerns' best practices, such that any team member has full domain over a particular feature, route, behavior, or other aspect of the site without causing conflict with another existing aspect.

Key features of the site include:
- Click Tracking available to entire site to track user activity and interaction behavior
- Image gallery with three (3) settings: default view, expanded view, and zoomed view
- Style selector with flexible icons and custom 'check mark' indication of selection (reused for image thumbnail selection)
- Add to Cart which limits quantity per customer, and ensures stock provided to customer for purchase matches inventory.
- Integrated share with various social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
- Related product cards which allow a "feature comparison" modal upon selection of the "star" on each product cart
- Outfit tracking, specific to the customer who is accessing the particular site instance, which persists between product windows
- Question and Answer generation, with helpfullness markers and reporting features
- Search feature for Q&A
- Ratings and Reviews generation, also with helpfullness markers and reporting features
- Ratings summary and product characteristic summary (size: too small, quality: perfect, etc.)
